## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on **DNS query flow**, incorporating **caching mechanisms** and **DNSSEC validation** for enhanced security. Itâ€™s designed to help you understand the step-by-step process of DNS resolution and how DNSSEC mitigates security risks like spoofing.

### Why This Matters
- **Caching reduces latency** by storing frequently accessed DNS records.
- **DNSSEC prevents spoofing attacks** by ensuring response authenticity.
- **Optimized query flow** improves performance and security.

## Documentation
