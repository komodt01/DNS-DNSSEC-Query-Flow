# Risks and Mitigations

| ID | Risk | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| R1 | DNS cache poisoning | An attacker injects forged records into a resolver’s cache, redirecting users to malicious hosts. | Users may be silently redirected to phishing or malware sites. | Use DNSSEC-validating recursive resolvers; enable DNSSEC on authoritative zones; monitor for unexpected answer changes. |
| R2 | DNS spoofing (off-path) | An attacker forges DNS responses faster than the legitimate server. | Compromised integrity of DNS answers. | Use DNSSEC; ensure resolvers use source-port and query-ID randomization; avoid open resolvers. |
| R3 | Misconfigured DNSSEC | Incorrect key sets, missing DS records, or expired signatures cause validation failure. | Legitimate domains become unreachable for validating clients. | Automate signing and rollover; test changes in staging; monitor for spikes in SERVFAIL and validation errors. |
| R4 | Compromise of signing keys | If DNSSEC private keys are stolen, an attacker can sign malicious records that validate as genuine. | Complete loss of trust in affected zones; potential large-scale redirection. | Protect private keys with HSMs or secure key stores; enforce strict access controls; rotate keys regularly; follow best practices for KSK/ZSK separation. |
| R5 | Weak or outdated crypto | Using deprecated algorithms or key sizes weakens DNSSEC protections. | Attackers may forge signatures or break validation. | Follow current DNSSEC algorithm and key length recommendations; phase out weak algorithms; track vendor and standards guidance. |
| R6 | Non-validating resolvers | Resolvers that do not perform DNSSEC validation accept and forward forged responses. | Users gain no benefit from signed zones; spoofing remains possible. | Prefer validating resolvers; enable validation where supported; document which resolvers are trusted. |
| R7 | Excessive TTLs | Very long TTLs keep records in cache even after security incidents or changes. | Slow propagation of remediation; users may continue to hit compromised or outdated endpoints. | Use TTLs that balance performance and agility; shorten TTLs before planned changes; consider lower TTLs for critical records. |
| R8 | Insufficient logging | Lack of DNS and DNSSEC logs makes investigation of attacks difficult. | Slow incident response and incomplete forensics. | Enable logging for DNS queries and validation failures; forward logs to SIEM; create alerts for anomalous patterns. |
| R9 | Split-horizon complexity | Using different answers internally vs externally can lead to DNSSEC misconfigurations. | Validation failures or inconsistent behavior for internal vs external clients. | Carefully design internal vs external zones; document which zones are signed; test resolution paths from multiple networks. |
| R10 | Human error in zone management | Manual edits, forgotten DS updates, or incorrect signing steps introduce errors. | Outages or validation failures affecting production domains. | Use change control, automation, and peer review; stage changes; maintain runbooks for signing and rollover procedures. |
